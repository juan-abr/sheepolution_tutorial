My progress on the sheepolution tutorial for Love 2D.
Tutorial can be found [here](https://sheepolution.com/learn/book/contents).

To run an individual tutorial programs:
1. Make sure you have Love installed.
2. Naviate into the directory of a specific chapter
3. "zip -r chapter[number].love * -x chapter[number]"
4. love chapter[number].love
